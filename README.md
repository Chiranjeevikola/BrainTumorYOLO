Brain tumors pose a significant health risk due to their impact on vital brain functions, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. 

Traditional imaging methods like CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray have limitations, such as high radiation exposure, reduced sensitivity for smaller tumors, 
high costs, and safety risks for vulnerable patients. 

To address these challenges, we propose an automated brain tumor detection and segmentation system using deep learning techniques. 

The existing systemâ€™s reliance on conventional methods is less efficient and accessible, while the proposed solution leverages the YOLOv4 framework for real-time, 
accurate tumor identification from MRI scans. By incorporating transfer learning, the system aims to enhance detection accuracy and reduce computational requirements, 
providing a safer, cost-effective alternative for early diagnosis.
