Brain tumors are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide because they affect the most vital organs of the human body. Brain cancer is currently the tenth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. It occurs when malignant cells grow uncontrollably in the brain. However, not all brain tumors are cancerous; some are benign (non-cancerous). Common types of brain cancer include glioma and meningioma. Brain tumors can be life-threatening, significantly impacting the quality of life of patients and their loved ones due to their aggressive nature and high mortality rate.

The prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis, which increases the chances of survival. Standard imaging techniques in medical science used to detect tumors include computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, and X-rays.

However, traditional imaging methods have significant drawbacks, such as increased cancer risk due to high radiation exposure, reduced sensitivity, potential harm to brain cells from ionizing radiation, high costs, and dangers to elderly patients and pregnant women.

To address these challenges, an automated brain tumor detection and segmentation system has been developed using some of the most advanced deep learning-based object detection algorithms. This system employs transfer learning techniques for detecting malignant tumors, such as glioblastoma, through MRI scans.

The cutting-edge object detection framework, YOLO (You Only Look Once), is utilized to identify and classify brain tumors through a deep learning approach. YOLOv4, a novel deep learning technique for object detection, offers reduced computational requirements compared to other models while
