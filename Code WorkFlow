This MATLAB code performs brain tumor classification using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and YOLOv4 for object detection. Below is a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initial Setup
- The code clears all previous variables (`clear all`), closes figures (`close all`), and clears the command window (`clc`).
- An image datastore (`imds`) is created to load images from a specified directory, with the labels derived from folder names. The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets.

2. CNN Architecture Definition
- A CNN model is defined with the following layers:
  - Input Layer: Takes images of size [200, 128, 3].
  - Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction is performed using convolutional layers with varying filter sizes.
  - Batch Normalization Layers: Normalize the activations and gradient propagation.
  - ReLU Layers: Apply non-linearity to the network.
  - Addition Layer and Pooling Layer: Used to merge and reduce the spatial dimensions.
  - Fully Connected Layer: Connects to the output classification.
  - Softmax Layer: Converts the output to probabilities.
  - Classification Layer: Produces the final prediction.

3. Layer Graph and Connections
- The layers are sequentially connected using `layerGraph`, and a skip connection is added to introduce a residual learning path, improving gradient flow.

4. Training the Network
- Training options are defined, including the optimizer (`adam`), batch size, learning rate, and maximum epochs. 
- The network is trained using `trainNetwork`, which updates weights based on training data.

5. Image Preprocessing for Prediction
- The user is prompted to select an image, which is read and preprocessed:
  - Converted to grayscale if needed.
  - Resized to the input size of the CNN.
  - Median filtering is applied to remove noise.

6. Tumor Detection using Region Properties
- The preprocessed image is binarized to identify regions.
- `regionprops` is used to compute the solidity and area of connected regions.
- High-density regions are considered potential tumors.
- Morphological operations further enhance the detected tumor region.

7. YOLOv4 Integration for Object Detection
- A pretrained YOLOv4 model (`YOLOv4-coco`) is loaded.
- The detected tumor is isolated, dilated, and displayed.

8. Feature Extraction
- Features such as contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, mean, standard deviation, entropy, and more are computed.
- These features could be used for further classification tasks.

9. Classification
- The trained CNN model classifies the tumor based on the input image.
- A message box displays the classification result.

10. Visualization
- Several figures display different stages of processing:
  - Initial grayscale, filtered, and reconstructed images.
  - Tumor detection and localization using bounding boxes.
  - Final classification output.

11. Performance Metrics
- Various performance metrics such as contrast, correlation, and texture features are calculated.
- Tumor boundaries are detected, and images are visualized with these boundaries highlighted.

The overall goal is to classify brain tumors using deep learning techniques and enhance detection through image preprocessing and object detection using YOLOv4.
